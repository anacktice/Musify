# Musify


## Overview


**Musify** is a free music player made using python. It allows the user to stream any song directly from the internet without lag in high quality. Along with that, you can also use this app to download any song of your choice. The song would be downloaded in your Music directory in your USERS folder.

For details on how to use the source code, see [Setup Guide](https://github.com/anacktice/Musify#setup)

## System requirements

- Windows 7 or above. (We are currently working on a linux version)
- A somewhat capable CPU.

```

#### Run Musify.pyw

#### Listen to the songs you like
Just enter the name of the song you would like to listen to and hit on the search icon, Musify will search for the song and play it, without any download. Or you can also hit the download button to download the song instead, directly to your Music directory.
